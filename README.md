## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop only
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use ternary operator and also how to style and change HTML elements on event.

From the HTML persective, I learned to provide to user different img quality depending on device using WEBP format and @2x formats for RETINA displey.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
     } else if (guess !== secretNumber) {
        if (score > 1) {
            message.innerHTML = guess > secretNumber ? 'Number to HIGH!' : 'Number to LOW!'
            score--;
            scoreElement.innerHTML = score;
        } else {
            message.innerHTML = `ðŸ¤¯ðŸ’¥ You lose the GAME!`;
        }
    }
```

### Continued development

building small vanilla JS project to master JavaScript and gain strong basics.
